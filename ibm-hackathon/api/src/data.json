I figured I'd grab some coffee before I fall asleep during a 30-minute drive and this location was on the way after leaving UNLV.\n\nI ordered a GRANDE mocha frappuccino with a shot of espresso, no whipped cream, and chocolate syrup on top. I repeated myself at least 3 times because the lady at the drive through kept saying the wrong thing. What they gave me the first time was a mocha frappuccino with whipped cream and chocolate chips - which was not what I asked for. The lady seemed annoyed. Within 10 seconds, she hands me a TALL (all 2/3 of it, so generous!) mocha frappuccino, no whipped cream, and chocolate syrup on top.\n\nThis would be the last time I'd go to this location.

                "text":"If I could, I would give this location NO stars. Unfortunately I have to give at least 1 in order to write a review and warn people about the extremely disrespectful employees at this location. I absolutely HATE this location. I visit starbucks a LOT - on a daily basis (sometimes 2 to 3 times a day), and in all the time I have been a customer with them I have never had such a horrible, humiliating experience. I went through the drive-thru to buy two toffee nut lattes with caramel drizzle around the cup, and a steak tomatillo wrap. When I payed  and received my items, I looked over my receipt and saw that I was charged $0.50 each just for the toffee nut syrup. At first it wasn't a big deal, I just thought \"oh that's new, I don't remember ever being charged for the specific syrup before at any other location.\" So I politely asked a woman named May in the window, \"when did they start charging for the toffee nut syrup? I've never seen that before.\" She rolled her eyes at me, gave me a dirty look, said \"well we do here\", and turned her back to me. I have already had problems with employees in the window giving me attitude at this location once before. I parked out front, went inside, and asked an employee if they could please give me the name of the woman in the window, because I needed it in order to file a complaint with the manager. Now, keep in mind, I have seizures and I stutter when my stress is increased. The male employee turned and laughed through my stuttering as I asked this and told me her name was May. He then continued chuckling and told me, \"you can complain all you want - nobody cares.\" Word. For. Word. No exaggeration. I couldn't take being talked down to there anymore, so I left. I went out to my car and called inside the store from there. A man picked up the phone, and I asked if I could please speak with the manager on shift. He replied, \"yeah that's me, this is my shift.\" I recognized his voice and asked him, \"are you the man I just talked to inside the store? The one who gave me May's name?\" He confirmed it was him I spoke to. So I asked him, \"Oh alright, so what is your name? And you said you're the manger? Because I will be talking to Lauren, the other manager, as soon as I can and telling her about what I experienced today.\" (Lauren is a very nice and polite manager I met the LAST time I had a problem here). He replied, \"My name is Gerardo, but no I'm not a manager.\" I told him, \"Wait a minute, but the first thing I asked when I called was if I was speaking to a manager, and you told me yes.\" He responded, \"No I didn't, because I'm not a manger. We don't have a manager working today.\" So long story short, I highly recommend never coming here. This all was completely avoidable and there was absolutely no reason I should've been treated this way.",

Never got a complaint from me...until today.\n\nI admit I do have a complex drink order. But I'm more than happy to repeating it 2 to 3 times to make sure they get it right. After saying my order to the older lady at the drive thru. She seemed hesitant but told me the price. I get iced espresso with added flavoring, soy and extra ice. This time around I asked for one shot less so I wouldn't be jittery; yet the price was more than my normal order. I assumed they raised the prices again. Pulled forward. Paid my drink and drove off.\n\nIt wasn't until I drove to work that I looked at my drink and saw that the label on my drink said macchiato which explained why the price shot up about 75 cents. After taking a sip or two, it tasted so bitter compared to what I normally get. So I called to speak with the manager. The manager seemed nice enough asking what drink I had. Then I heard the same lady from the drive thru arguing in the background saying it wasn't true. That it was the right drink. She just charged me wrong but I got what I ordered. She proceeded to get on the phone and explain this to me. I was clocking into work so I didn't want to argue over a few cents with someone that was obviously acting defensive.\n\nAfter trying to drink a little longer I realize that there was no flavoring at all. Which I paid more to be put in the drink in the first place.\n\nI'm going to wait until the manager. I was a barista at Starbucks and never did I even think about getting on the phone and arguing with a customer.\n\nI will now take the longer route to go to a different Starbucks. At least that one has some customer service.",

I came here to read a few books and study and the noise was quiet to moderate. The place was kept clean. I don't remember if this is the location that just had the hand drier in the bathroom, usually they also offer paper towels.\n\nThe drinks are pretty universal when you're talking about starbucks. I get the caramel macchiato and it is done. The staff is friendly as well. I also tried one of their fraps which was decent. Another note, I shouldn't complain about starbucks prices but they are relatively expensive. And the line can get a little long.\n\nIn terms of pastries, they are average to good. Starbucks always changes up their pastries so its hard to judge the places. For instance, I used to love getting the chocolate cake pop. Some places have them others don't. Another thing was the rice krispy treats, they seemed to have done away with that completely and now only have the factory wrapped ones which aren't nearly as good. \n\nOther than this I don't have much to say.

I literally have gone here three time first two times weren't bad at all UNTIL today it was so bad I have to write a review because I'm not coming here again. We pull up to the window and tell this lady our order which I don't think she was listening because she repeated it and was not what we ordered. THEN we repeat the order and she still doesn't get it so I from the passenger side had to shout over my sister to correct this order. After this happened I was like okay well... let's see how the order goes. First I get my strawberry refresher which one had NO strawberries, I only asked her if she would be able to add strawberries she looked at me as if I asked her to give me my money back. Second she gives us the grande drink which the cap of it \"DOESNT FIT\" mind you we are in the car and the drink had whip cream up top. So I asked is there anything that fits the cap she AGAIN looked at me like I was in the wrong. She took it back and said oh I there's nothing that fits, so in my defensive this can't be the first time this has happened people must be complaining about that cause whip cream spilled when she handed us the drink. Not to mention she gave me the food I ordered and then said, \"oh never mind give that back that's not your order.\" Literally just wanted to leave but they still had my damn drink putting strawberries in it during this whole process. SUPER ANNOYED. Not coming back!",

My favorite Starbucks Coffee Shop that just melts me like butter on pancakes, like whipped cream over hot chocolate is now in a newer, bigger location transferring from 395 Hughes Center Dr. to this location by the corner of Hughes Center Parkway, on E. Flamingo Road. So it is a welcoming place as it is a stand-alone building that's newly-built. Wide, panoramic windows lets in the light for a brighter feel with roadside views. Oh, to just people-watch or rather vehicles-passing-by-watch for the watcher in you! As expected, the effervescence of hot brewed coffee permeates the air and lingers to my nostrils' delight! Jazz music adds to the vibe, allowing my senses to relax and imbibe on a beverage of my choice. Take a pick from nice brewed green hot tea, decaffeinated coffee, cool iced tea, delicious coffee, and  various beverages. Choices of baked goods from bagels, to cakes as well as sandwiches and an assortment of desserts, bagels, chips, nuts, meal wraps, dried fruit to whet your appetite. Imbibe, linger, socialize over delicious beverages indoors or outdoors on its small patio under green umbrellas for delighting in the fresh air. Also a breeze of a gain from getting feet off the ground just to obtain the beverage while on-the-run via its Drive-Thru service. Starbucks looks like a little castle surrounded by spaceousness. Ample parking surrounds the new contemporary building. Coffee Hours are from Mondays - Sundays at 4:30 AM - 12:00 AM...that's great hours for the owls and early risers. Coffee servers are ever attentive and happy to serve. Sip your favorite beverages or Coffee, anyone?",

I was impressed with the amount of space this one offers and how friendly, helpful and quick the service was that I received. Inside is kind of long and narrow and they have plenty of tables scattered about and a long bar with stools as well a nice long table to that's hard to miss as you walk in. They had plenty of fresh fruit available and the usual pastries. The inside was a bit crowded, so after sitting inside for about 10 minutes I decided to move out to the patio since it was a nice afternoon outside. They have tables and chairs outside the front door and then a spacious patio on the side on the building with tables and chairs. If you are one of those who loves a Starbucks with a drve-thru then you will be happy to find out that is an option here as well. All in all this is a solid location and am glad I stopped by.",

All of my visits to this location have been between 7am and 8:30am. \n\nTo be honest, I try to take advantage of the coffee we have at work. My thought behind this is that if I can save money that would otherwise be spent on Starbucks, I can use that on ordering all the things at a new place on my \"need to try sometime\" list. But, on the occasional \"eff it Friday,\" this is my go-to location for a few reasons:\n\n1. Proximity. It's on the way to work. Enough said there. \n2. Drive thru. It's early. I'm lazy. Sue me.\n3. Service. The woman who usually works the drive-thru window is so bright and cheery that it's contagious. I'd even dare to say that I end up not needing the caffeine boost from the venti pike roast that I usually order. \n4. Speed. I usually arrive before the line is so horrendously long that you decide to walk in and save some time. However, on the few occasions where the drive-thru line snaked beyond the allotted path, the wait was always far shorter than I would imagine. \n5. Ability to redeem rewards. I work on the strip. I usually take in an afternoon treat at the Starbucks nearest to me, but the problem is that location can't take rewards. It's annoying. It's lame. I can't change it. Thankfully, this location gives me a chance to prevent that hard earned overly priced reward from going to waste. \n\nGood, solid, spot.",

Especially during peak hours. When the line is really long for the drive-thru I usually just go inside and order because the drink gets made a lot faster. When the place is busy they also run out of parking spaces so you have to park on the dirt to the left of the building.\nThe only reason why I don't give them 5 stars is because the prices at this location are ridiculous. They charge more because they are so close to the strip and they get a lot of tourists, but still, I shouldn't have to pay over $5 for a venti iced tea.

The baristas are so nice and the drinks are always perfect. The inside is also very nice compared to other Starbucks. \n\nI never knew you could order drinks in a real cup and I saw a barista named Chelsea making a flat white and she make a little design on top! It was so cute and I complimented her on it and she made me one! So very nice of her, made my day, and reminds me why I love Starbucks so much! Thank you!",

But not this bunch; they're friendly, efficient, and\nforever smiling(alliteration is my OCD, I shall not want). I've encountered 20 different employees\nsince I started coming here(03/2015) and all of them know their drill, no matter where they're positioned. The crowd is varied, but the overwhelming demographic seems to be cab drivers.\nAll of them courteous, kind, and faithful to the law of the pack. This starbucks also employes\na feature I hadn't seen at any other SB, a printed label affixed to your beverage cup that gives \ncustomers first name, volume of drink, and description of drink(quad expresso, decaf, ice). They've all but eliminated the infrequent but nonetheless, annoying peccadillo of giving your \ndrink away to someone who doesn't speak inglesi. Perdoname, maestro, tiene mi  cafe. Dame\npor favor. Gracias ,Senor. Vaya bien. While you stumble through the best imitation you can muster, your drink is losing its maxissimo poder. Starbucks creativity to the rescue! They have also got a better line of edibles than the others, featuring my favorite a sandwich made with flatbread, which looks like a thick saltine cracker(1/2\")with a choice of vegetable and chicken,\nor full on veggie innards.

I ordered a decaf white chocolate mocha frapp with an extra pump of white chocolate mocha. It lacked flavor and I couldn't taste the white mocha. Perhaps they were skimping in ingredients to save money but why? The cost of the drink covers the cost of ingredients!? \n\nUnfortunately my lemon loaf was dry and I was unable to finish it. I thought Starbucks had fresh pastries...that wasn't fresh. \n\nThe Starbucks on the strip cost a lot more but I've never had these problems. Please please please address these issues Starbucks.

Because we all know Starbuck shops are like Vampires, some sparkle & shine and others just suck the life out of you. \n\nI almost never write reviews about large chains, but this Starbucks has to be the best looking location in Vegas. High ceilings, plenty of room to work, and two, count em', two patios. One in the front and one on the side, both nonsmoking! \n\nThis location also boasts a very fast drive-thru and a hard working crew.

If the drink isn't up to part, they will offer replacements to meet customer satisfaction? \n\nClearly there was miscommunication but it could've been avoided if their staff were to listen and probably repeat the order and not assume they noted it down?

As Starbucks continues it's world domination of the coffee market I think I am starting to see more inconsistencies in their stores than I used to and I have decided to start reviewing them. \n\nI travel for work and I generally try to go to a \"non-Starbucks\" whenever I can but sometimes you need their market penetration. You want a coffee, and there are 4 Starbucks within a block of your hotel. You know?\n\nIt's Vegas. It's just off the strip. I like that it is a stand alone Starbucks and not in a casino or airport. It's pretty big. Plenty of bar top and tables to sit and get some work done.  The store does look to be fairly new.  Wi-Fi of course. Music was playing of course. All the typical Starbucks trappings. \n\nFor those interested it also has a drive thru. \n\nIt feels dirty. Like a lot of Starbucks lately it feels like the place is not well taken care of.  Tables and floor need attention. It's a Sunday, it's mid morning, so I know the place has been hit but come on! Let's grab a rag and do a wipe down. \n\nParking lot is a mess. Judging by how run over the trash is, it's been a few days since anyone has put any effort in out there. \n\nCoffee was fine. I had a blond roast drop and as nearly always is the case, their coffee is not 100% consistent across all stores. Let's just start taking care of the facility a little bit. \n\nCream bar was messy and had only one thermos of I'm not sure what. Not labeled but I took a shot. It was something dairy enough for me. I was looking for half and half so I'm ok. Maybe you can ask if you want something else. \n\nThe pastry case and food shelves looked a little sparse too. Not sure if they were just wiped out or what but it was just messy and empty.  \n\nI feel like Starbucks is just like any other fast food place. The food is consistent. The facility gets hit hard. \n\nThe people were great. Guy that helped me at the register was very nice.",

I will keep coming but not to hang out like in my former one. I order my coffee I get in and get out with hopefully no boot on my car. \n\nOn that note take care about where you park outside theres a building next door called the key man building and while I have yet to figure out if theres any actual running offices in this particular builing they will boot/tow your car with no mercy at all I have seen people park in the flower beds in the starbucks parking lot just to avoid parking ONE SPACE over from where the starbucks parking lot ends even though this office building doesn't even seem to need all the spaces at all.",

This location in particular boasts a spacious interior with a fireplace, and various seating options.  \n\nLocated in Dilworth, on the corner of East and the one-way Scott, it can be a bit of a challenge to get in and out of for anyone that is not a \"local.\"  The tiny parking lot doesn't help much.  Some spaces are 15 minutes only, some are for Starbucks patrons only, it crosses North and South with East and West, and just leaves you feeling ahhhhhhh by the time you actually throw the gear shift in park.  Perhaps planned that way to make you \"need\" coffee even more?  #conspiracy \n\nIt's really not that bad once you get used to it though.  Just be careful for all of the parking lot potholes in need of some fresh paving.  They are great if you want your coffee sloshed out of the cup and into your lap.  If that's not your goal, take it slow on the way out.  It's also in a very walkable location for just about anyone in Dilworth, which I find to be a better option.  I like to park over at the Fresh Market, walk to get my coffee, and then head back over to do my shopping.  \n\nThis location seems to be the \"flagship\" location for Charlotte as it is the first to test new drinks, etc.  It was the first location in Charlotte to rollout the \"evening menu,\" including wines, as well.  The staff is always friendly here, but I've noticed that the cleanliness is greatly varied based on when the general manager is on duty.  She runs a tight ship and things are always up to par when she's in-house.  \n\nThis location is also one of the few with full bathrooms versus just the single standard toilet.  Given the traffic they get, I think it was a wise investment.  \n\nThe WiFi here is generally reliable and there's ample space to plug-in and juice up.  The communal table running up the center of the space has it's own outlets too.\n\nHit'em up when you need to make a buck stop or just get a little work done outside of the office.",

                "text":"When it comes to coffee shops (and restaurants), my mantra is \"choose local\"... except at airports - you can't escape those franchises!. Yes, I am aware that I am not the first to think like this. On top of it to being beneficial for the local economy, I like that their ambiance tends to be warmer and quirkier paired with tasty foods and drinks! However, I have broken this rule with this Starbucks. The reason? The combination of location and, most importantly, outside seating. So, this is the basis of my review, not service, not products - those are pretty standard. \n\nIt is not news that the drive down East Blvd. is beautiful with its historic houses surrounded by hints of spring. So that adds coolness points to this coffee shop. But what sold me immediately was the 2 level outside seating. Perfect for getting some work done! Although if you need to plug your computer, there's only one spot where you can sit. Regardless, this seating area is ample. There are ~10 tables that seat multiple people each. It's surrounded by trees that give you the perfect amount of shade while also getting your Vitamin D fix. \n\nThis place is no secret... I wish it was. It tends to be crowded during peak hours. So, parking is an issue. When in doubt if it is an authorized parking spot, don't park.  I've seen cars getting booted multiple times. And of course it goes without saying - finding a spot to sit, will also be an issue.\n\nSo, there it is - my confession. Although in my defense, when I first noticed this place I did not even think it was a Starbucks. The sign is kinda hidden depending on the direction in which you're driving.  Writing this review made me realize that I don't know of another coffee shop with plenty of outside seating. If someone can point me in that direction, I'd be more than happy to support some local places.",

So the customer experiences suffers. \n\nI come to this Starbucks a lot since it's by the park and I order pretty simple drinks but almost every single time I visit this location my drink is either wrong or they put such little effort into the drink that it has to be remade. This is a trend that has gotten worse over the past 12 months or so. \n\nExample: I order a matcha green tea lemonade and they don't mix up the matcha powder. Or you wait 15 mins while there was only a few drinks ahead of you and the employees just lackadaisically move around and complain about their workplace. \n\nI want to love this location, it's in a great spot and the building is cool but my goodness is the service bad. If the service is this bad the management at this location must either be nonexistent or just don't care. \n\nStarbucks corporate needs to take a good hard look at the customer experience here and look past the numbers (cause I'm sure this location is incredibly profitable) and look at how it's being managed and how employees are being trained. When you pay $5 for a coffee and almost every time you visit this location it's not up to the quality that Starbucks projects then that's a massive issue. \n\nA mistake or issue every now and then is only human but a significant pattern of error is a problem. \n\nPlus the location in Elizabeth off 7th street just closed so there isn't other options near by if you live in Plaza.

                "text":"Ever since Caribou Coffee closed on East Blvd, getting into Starbucks has been a nightmare.  I used to stop there every Saturday for a drink, perhaps lunch, too.  Then they stopped carrying their food items when they took on La Boulange items (French for \"tastes like cardboard,\" I think).  After that, I took it upon myself to never buy food again at Starbucks until they came to their senses and got rid of La Boulange.  So now any time I stop, it's JUST for drinks.  Which in itself can be a nightmare.\n\nThis past Saturday, I visited Starbucks on East Blvd for an iced coffee.  I took the only parking spot that was left in their bumpy, pothole-y, limited-space parking lot.  I was happy to see that the line to order was incredibly short and quickly placed my order.  What I didn't notice was the throng of people surrounding the other end of the counter, waiting for their drinks.  While the SB employees appeared to be working very quickly, the demand was more than they could reasonably handle and produce.  (Hey, SB managers -- how about scheduling more employees for one of the busiest times of the day?)\n\nWhile waiting for almost 10 minutes for my simple, basic iced coffee (pouring it from a pitcher into a cup), I looked around the establishment.  They've recently renovated (again) and, if it's possible, there is even less seating to meet the demand of the number of people that frequent this particular restaurant.  For one thing, there are fewer individual tables.  For another, there aren't enough chairs to even accommodate those tables.  There were empty tables with no chairs around them!  They've also gone with the space-hogging long community tables, like anyone who goes to SB with a book, laptop, friend, etc. wants to sit closely with another party.  One thing that used to make SB great was the intimacy it provided for its patrons.  I guess that's out the refurbished window.  The drink delay also gave me a chance to get a really good look at the cleanliness of the tables, and especially the common area with the cream, sugar, etc.  It was not replenished and filthy.  FIL-THY.  The garbage was overflowing onto the counter.  It looked abandoned.  Someone really needed to get out on the floor (hello, manager again!) and CLEAN. THINGS. UP.   The outside seating wasn't much cleaner.  \n\nEvery time I go to this Starbucks, it seems like they've renovated again, but it seems like when they do, they always miss big opportunities:  more seating, more staff, cleaner facilities.  Starbucks should reasonably be embarrassed by this store.",

Since they started their new policy of heating up more pastries, trying to get a breakfast sandwhich takes forever and its been so chaotic that they have forgotten my order or given mine to sonebody else on a few occasions. Additionally they have run out of breakfast sandwiches a few times now, including today, and its not like I got there too late or anything. Frankly it's become a totally annoying experience when it used to be a nice weekend morning retreat. Too bad the Dilworth neighborhood doesn't have many inexpensive breakfast options any more.",

They use to tow you the second you walked in the door if you were parked in a spot that was not marked Starbucks.

(the first time I visited, they didn't, but it seems they were on it the second time around). The staff are friendly and they do a great job with the drinks.\n\nIt's also the most unique Starbucks I've ever been in. Located in an old house, it's not anything like the other Starbucks, other than the counter of course. There is so much seating here, too.\n\nI would only complain about the floor outlets as they don't seem to work for charging your computer. But no other Starbucks I know of has floor outlets. I don't think Starbucks intended people use the floor outlets; I think they were just there previously before the Starbucks moved in. The wall outlets work great. \n\nIt's a busy location, just so you know. You can expect a little delay in your drink but that happens with the business.\n\nThey don't have a drive thru as there's no space for one here. That's not a big deal for me, however, because I take the bus anyway. Public transit is pretty good in Charlotte, though it does tend to run a bit later than scheduled. But buses run late at night as well as the light rail. I would recommend getting to this Starbucks via public transportation just because the parking looks like it could be a little crazy. It's not far from the East/West Blvd Lynx light rail station and it's just one bus ride away, just take route 25 there. \n\nI still want to check out the Steele Creek Starbucks as I've heard good things about it but I think the East Blvd Starbucks will be my regular Starbucks from this point on.",

Employees write rude, weird things on cups and think it's funny. They seem to think they are better than the guests and they are incapable of making the specialty drinks correctly. I can't stand going in here and drive out of my way to go to a different one. They take SO MUCH LONGER than anyone else does and seem to be moving in ultra slow motion. Really bad service, poorly made drinks and RUDE beyond words. NEVER going back. I am in Charlotte a lot and have decided to go to DD or find a different Starbucks in the area.",

However, I will say that the environment of this particular location is what makes it better than any other in Charlotte. It is VERY spacious, and there are ample outlets situated around the store for you to plug in your lap top.  I've literally parked it here for hours doing school work and no one ever bothers me.  The only negative is parking.  If you come here during peak times (i.e. saturday afternoon, or the after work rush) parking is a beast.  Be aware that there are towing sharks around here.  Towing has been such a problem that Starbucks has a huge chart on their front door showing where and where not to park.  Other than that, this has been my new fav school work/caffeine intake hangout!",
